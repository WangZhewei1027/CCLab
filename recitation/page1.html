  <h1>About this project</h1>
  <p>
    Users can generate some cells at the mouse position by clicking.

    In the first place, my work refers to the concept of “Conway’s the game of life”. If the cells are surrounded by too
    many other cells, they will die because of the lack of space to breathe; If the cells are too lonely, with no cell
    nearby, they will also die because of the loneliness.

    Move the mouse around, you will observe how the cells try to avoid the mouse, and the interesting visual effect.

    Allow the microphone request from the browser, you can see the groove of sound visually displayed on the screen. The
    circle implies the sound level of every certain moment. Also, the cells will interact with the sound, which may
    accelerate their growth or death process.
